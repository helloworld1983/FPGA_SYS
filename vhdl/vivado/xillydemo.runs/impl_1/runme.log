Phase 1.1.2 IO and Clk Clean Up
WARNING: [Place 30-172] Sub-optimal placement for a clock-capable IO pin and PLL pair. This is normally an ERROR but the CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE constraint is set to FALSE allowing your design to continue. The use of this override is highly discouraged as it may lead to very poor timing results. It is recommended that this error condition be corrected in the design.

	clk_100_IBUF_inst (IBUF.O) is locked to IOB_X0Y78
	audio_ins/plle2_adv_inst (PLLE2_ADV.CLKIN1) is locked to PLLE2_ADV_X0Y0
Resolution: A dedicated routing path between the two can be used if: (a) The clock-capable IO (CCIO) is placed on a CCIO capable site (b) The PLL is placed in the same clock region as the CCIO pin. Both the above conditions must be met at the same time, else it may lead to longer and less predictable clock insertion delays.

WARNING: [DRC 23-20] Rule violation (PLCK-20) Clock Placer Checks - Sub-optimal placement for a clock-capable IO pin and PLL pair. 
Resolution: A dedicated routing path between the two can be used if: (a) The clock-capable IO (CCIO) is placed on a CCIO capable site (b) The PLL is placed in the same clock region as the CCIO pin. Both the above conditions must be met at the same time, else it may lead to longer and less predictable clock insertion delays.
This is normally an ERROR but the CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE constraint is set to FALSE allowing your design to continue. The use of this override is highly discouraged as it may lead to very poor timing results. It is recommended that this error condition be corrected in the design.

Phase 1.1.2 IO and Clk Clean Up
WARNING: [Place 30-172] Sub-optimal placement for a clock-capable IO pin and PLL pair. This is normally an ERROR but the CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE constraint is set to FALSE allowing your design to continue. The use of this override is highly discouraged as it may lead to very poor timing results. It is recommended that this error condition be corrected in the design.

	clk_100_IBUF_inst (IBUF.O) is locked to IOB_X0Y78
	audio_ins/plle2_adv_inst (PLLE2_ADV.CLKIN1) is locked to PLLE2_ADV_X0Y0
Resolution: A dedicated routing path between the two can be used if: (a) The clock-capable IO (CCIO) is placed on a CCIO capable site (b) The PLL is placed in the same clock region as the CCIO pin. Both the above conditions must be met at the same time, else it may lead to longer and less predictable clock insertion delays.

WARNING: [DRC 23-20] Rule violation (PLCK-20) Clock Placer Checks - Sub-optimal placement for a clock-capable IO pin and PLL pair. 
Resolution: A dedicated routing path between the two can be used if: (a) The clock-capable IO (CCIO) is placed on a CCIO capable site (b) The PLL is placed in the same clock region as the CCIO pin. Both the above conditions must be met at the same time, else it may lead to longer and less predictable clock insertion delays.
This is normally an ERROR but the CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE constraint is set to FALSE allowing your design to continue. The use of this override is highly discouraged as it may lead to very poor timing results. It is recommended that this error condition be corrected in the design.
